3- Define the main() function:

* It prompts the user to enter a URL they want to shorten.

* It then calls the shorten_url() function with the user-provided URL.


4-In the main() function:

* The user is prompted to enter a URL.

*The shorten_url() function is called with the entered URL, and the shortened URL is stored.


5- Finally, the shortened URL is printed to the console.

6- The __name__ block ensures that the main() function is called when the script is run directly.
